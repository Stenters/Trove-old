## Synopsis
* The party began on the docks of [[Royal Blue]], searching for a ship to commandeer after their recent losses of transportation
* On their way over, [[Captain Cilver | Cilver]] and [[Sallhador]] were able to recruit [[Chimaaro]], [[Closh]], and [[Cricket | an unnamed orc]] with the help of [[Rango]]
* [[Valor]] was able to pick up [[Kinu]] with the promise of quick passage off [[Terra Rusk]]
* At the dockside, Cilver broke the news to everyone that the crew didn't *exactly* have a ship, but that lapse would be corrected in short order
* After convincing everyone that keeping in the crew was the best course of action, Cilver began sizing up the potential options
* Five ships were currently in dock: [[Military vessle]], [[Fancy ship]], [[Jellyfish craft]], [[Old ship]], and [[Sky turtle barge]]
<br>
* After discussing for some time, Cilver sent Valor to investigate the Jellyfish craft
* Valor, using her excilent skills to blend into the crown, made her way over to the craft, where she was met with [[Glib]], one of the Jellyfish's crew
* Glib, noticing that Rango was aggressively following Valor, invited her on in an attempt to rescue her from a percived stalker
* Glib uses some sort of code to gain entrance to the ship, although no guards are visible
* Once aboard, Valor learned from Glib that there were 3 other crew members
* In an attempt to improve the situation, Valor tries to convince the crew to go into town to get *drugs*
* Unfortunately, she only convinces Glib
<br>
* In the meantime, Cilver has come over to Rango and dissuaded him from following Valor, but not before noting the arcane force guarding the gangplank
* Cilver redirects Rango to follow Kinu instead
* Kinu had gone over to investigate the turtle barge more closely, and showed Rango how to properly pet them
<br>
* Valor and Glib departed with , and the unnamed orc decided to tag along
* They found a tavern named [[The Mushroom Bar]]
* A tired, bored bar tender greeted them, and shut down any hopes of finding drugs, clarifying all he served was mushroom suffle
* Valor, at wits end, orders two and attempts to drug Glib's food
* The unnamed orc picks up on this and, throwing a stone through the window as a distraction, pours some sort of powedr in Glib's beer
* After drugging the grung, Valor and Sallhador interrogate him, learning the password to the jellyfish ship - a phrase in primordial, as well as details about the captain, [[Captain Short Jhim Gold | Short Jhim Gold]]
* They learn that the captain in intrigued with arcane secrets, especially: "Weird magic shit", old stories, and dragons
<br>
* While Valor and co are on this escapade, Cilver has been performing recconisance
* After studying the Jellyfish craft, Cilver determined there were at least 5 protective runes on the ship, and no obvious mechanisms for flying it other than magic
* Investigating the old, rickety ship, Cilver notices an older officer running a fresh faced crew through basic routines, which they are failing spectacularly at
* Moving on to the military vessle, Cilver learns that these "Needle Ships" have been seen much more frequently, and although not explicitly associated with [[Kargad]], many assume they are emmisaries from there
<br>
* Eventually, the party regroups at the dockside bar
* Cilver convinces Glib to sign on with them, at which point Sallhador produces a contract that Glib signs
* While initially everyone is set on stealing the Jellyfish craft, [[Chimaaro]] mentions that there is a square dancing competition on the Fancy craft, which may provide an in to steal that ship
* Cilver discusses with Valor, Closh, and the unnamed orc about raiding the Jellyfish craft while the competition is ongoing, which the orc shoots down
* The party as a whole decides they have the means to pilot the fancy ship, and decide to wait till the competition to steal any ship
* Rango, promised to be the pilot of the ship, excitedly demands beer from the barkeep, terrifying the poor man into giving in for free
* Cilver works an agreement, paying a small sum for unlimited refills
* The party then makes their way over to the fancy ship, with Cilver, Rango, Closh, and Chimaaro signing up for the square dancing competition, as well as the orc under the assumed name "Cricket"
<br>
* By the time of the party, Rango is *very* drunk
* With permission from Cilver, Chimaaro gives him something that tastes like seaweed, which gives him a jolt of energy and focus
* Those who signed up for the competition are ushered by the fancy ship, where they work through a series of complex trials to qualify for the dance
* Despite the best efforts of Cilver and Rango, Chimaaro is eliminated on the rope swing trials
* The rest of the crew passes
<br>
* Kinu and Valor decide to take the time to investigate the fancy ship
* Trying to get below decks, they notice everything is tightly guarded
* Kinu decides to talk to one of the officers on the ship
* They learn he is interning on this ship under [[Captain Johnson]]
* When asking about the square dance competition, learn that it is holiday back where the ship came from, [[Tinkertock]]
* There is apparently a significant platinum reward for the winner
* While talking to the officer, Valor and Kinu notice a flash from the forward office
* Kinu recognizes a silhouette in black needle armor, similar to the military ship
* The officer, seeing the signal, instructs them to leave the ship
* As they leave, Kinu trips and bowls into two crew mates, giving a chance for Valor to slip away and drop over the handrail, hanging out of sight of the crew
<br>
* Back on shore, Kinu meets up with Chimaaro, and explains that the dance is definetly a trap
* Chim is confused and has no idea how to react
* While they are trying to decide on a cource of action, the dance begins
* Immediately, crew members fire weighted nets at the participants, pinning them down in the middle of the deck
* The ship blasts those on shore away with magical air, then carreens out of port
* Valor, having sidled to the aft deck, barley climbs back over the railing in time to not be shaken free
* Back on shore, Kinu and Chim rush to the sky turtle barge and break it free from its flimsy padlock, and begin chasing the ship carrying off the rest of their crew
* Glib, who spent most of this time sleeping, is quite disoriented, but at the last minute jumps on the barge with Kinu and Chim
